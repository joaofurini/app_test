# Vlorish Testüìú

This Flutter App is a test project designed to showcase the capabilities of Flutter in building a simple yet practical mobile application. The app's primary function is to calculate the sum of all numbers between two specified target values provided by the user. This project serves as a great starting point to showcase basic UI design, user input handling, and algorithm implementation.

## Time Complexity ‚òïÔ∏è

The time complexity of the provided code is O(n), where 'n' is the absolute difference between startNum and endNum, plus one.
It's not possible to achieve a time complexity of O(log n) for this problem. The reason is that you are required to calculate the sum of all the numbers between startNum and endNum, which inherently involves visiting each number at least once.
